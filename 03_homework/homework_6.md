**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

I have co-authored 3 Search Fund Studies with the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies (CES) at the Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB). These are biennial studies on ‘search funds’ to provide insight into the factors that influence successful outcomes for a first-time owner-manager and their group of advising investors. A search fund is a financial vehicle created by a single or a group of individuals who raise money from group of advising investors to support their efforts to first search and locate, and then acquire and lead a privately held company over the medium to long term. In short, a search fund is a means of Entrepreneurship through Acquisition (ETA).

Methodology has been to do a survey, using an online survey tool, of the people currently running/ exited/ shut down a company acquired through a search fund, those currently searching for a company to acquire or those in the process of raising a search fund in USA and Canada. I am involved in designing the questionnaire/ survey, reaching out to people for responses, doing the analysis and assisting in writing the report. 

Since the data wasn’t huge, Excel has been the go-to tool for everything including data storage and analysis. But this has seen exponential growth in the last few years and hence CES has decided to set up a proper database system to store data and use python to do the analysis going forward to make the whole process more efficient and be able to do better analysis. This is where I find the direct relevance of not only the technical skills being taught in the program but also the ethical and equity considerations associated with data. Below are some of the areas which are relevant to the example I have quoted above – 

Privacy and privacy issues – When designing the new database system, CES needs to ensure that sensitive information about the entrepreneurs and their companies like the company financials, salary, equity etc are protected while being used for analysis at the same time. Traditionally, CES has done a great job when it comes to privacy and transparency. Survey participants have been provided with information on what data is being collected and on how it is being used. This should continue as before.

Security and appropriate access – Robust access control is extremely important and has been one of the primary reasons for moving away from excel based models. CES needs to clearly define who all are authorized to access the data and grant appropriate permissions to the same.

Database design – Search fund model is at a nascent stage and continuously evolving. Therefore, it is imperative that the database be dynamic enough to be able to adopt different versions of the search fund model e.g. people who fund their searches themselves (self-funded search), those funded by search fund aggregators and so on. This would help expand the scope, get more data, do better analysis, and generate better insights.
